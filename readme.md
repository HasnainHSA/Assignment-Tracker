### Formatting Notes
- **Headings**: Used `#` for the title and `##` for sections, following standard README conventions.
- **Code Blocks**: Wrapped commands in triple backticks (```bash) for proper syntax highlighting.
- **Lists**: Used `-` for unordered lists and `1.` for ordered steps, keeping it clean and readable.
- **Emphasis**: Applied bold (`**`) and italics (`*`) where appropriate to highlight key points or notes.
- **Separators**: Added `---` between sections for visual clarity.
